Sources generated by Sailfish and ‘harvested’ from the code variable of _update_compute_code function in subdomain_runner.py through debugging of following examples:

	examples/cylinder.py —> sailfish_cylinder.cu
	examples/ldc_2d.py —> sailfish_ldc_2d.cu
	examples/ldc_2d.py —> sailfish_ldc_2d_clean.cu
	examples/ldc_3d.py —> sailfish_ldc_3d.cu

sailfish_ldc_2d_clean.cu is just sailfish_ldc_2d.cu but cleaned from most of the useless code and spaces.

Except some very slight differences in function call and test order, all these codes are exactly the same.
