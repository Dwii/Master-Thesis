TODO list:
----------

	- makefile: Understand and fix nvcc -M usage (auto-dependencies). It's not working ATM.

	- makefile: Understand nvcc+gcc build process to use them together to include pgm library.

	- Cuda: Implement a more clever block size/thread distribution of the kernels.

	- Cuda: Reduce number of different kernels (if possible) and check if it speeds up.

	- Cuda: Consider texture for constants (for obstacles in particular) and check if it speeds up.

	- general architecture: Use dynamically sized arrays. Having to recompile each time NX/NY changes is bad...
